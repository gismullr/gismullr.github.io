      <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Gisele Muller Sasso. Wife, mom,  <a href="http://www.jazzercise.com/">Jazzercise</a>  instructor, writer and occasional runner. I'm also the PR person for our side project <a href="https://bullish.email/">Bullish</a>, a stock market-related newsletter for all the investing nerds out there.</p>
<p>I'm a Brazilian expat turned American currently living in beautiful Santa Cruz, CA. I moved to the United States in 2011 after a project my husband and I launched together got some attention from  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/mentaway/">TechCrunch</a>  and opened a few doors. Many years, a kid and a mortgage later Iâ€™m pretty happy with how things turned out.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I've been dedicating myself to motherhood and working on freelance writing and translation projects. And I was able to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Working with my husband - a software engineer - on several side projects taught me a lot about technology and project management. And it also showed me that you need to hustle to get your ideas out there. In a sea full of fish, you have to swim faster to stay ahead.</p>
<p>You can follow me on  <a href="https://twitter.com/gismullr">Twitter</a>  or  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gismullr/">Instagram</a> . And check out some of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@gismullr">Medium</a>  one of these days. Keep you posted.</p>
