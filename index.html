      <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Gisele Muller Sasso. Wife, mom,  <a href="http://www.jazzercise.com/">Jazzercise</a>  instructor, writer, occasional runner, and now, a <a href="https://giselesasso.com/">real estate agent</a> in beautiful Santa Cruz, CA. On top of that, Iâ€™ve written an ebook about password security and why you need a password manager â€” grab yours <a href="https://gismullr.gumroad.com/l/ispasswordyourpassword">here</a>. </p>
<p>Originally from Brazil, I moved to the U.S. in 2011 after a project my husband and I launched got attention from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/mentaway/">TechCrunch</a>  and opened a few doors for us. Many years, a kid and a mortgage later Iâ€™m pretty happy with how things turned out.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been balancing motherhood with freelance writing and translation jobs, enjoying the flexibility to pursue my passions while being there for my daughter. Working with my husband, whoâ€™s a software engineer, on various side projects taught me a lot about technology, project management, and the hustle it takes to bring ideas to life.</p>
<p>Now Iâ€™m putting that same energy and dedication into real estate. Helping people find their perfect home feels like a natural extension of everything Iâ€™ve learned along the way. Whether youâ€™re looking to buy, sell, or just chat about the Santa Cruz market, letâ€™s connectâ€”Iâ€™d love to help!</p>
<p>You can follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gismullr/">Instagram</a>. And check out some of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@gismullr">Medium</a>.</p>
